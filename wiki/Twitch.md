Free Code Camp uses Twitch.tv to broadcast live streams. These can be anything from live pair programming to their monthly Summit, where big news events and new developments are announced.

All levels of coders are encouraged to stream on the Free Code Camp twitch channel. If this is something that would interest you, please contact Briana on [gitter](https://gitter.im/brianamarie) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/brianamarie132).

More information on how to stream can be found [here](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Stream-Your-Coding-Sessions-on-Twitch.tv).
