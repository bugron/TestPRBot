In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select DOM elements.

basic selectors like `a` or `h1`
```css
a { color: black; }
h1 { font-size 24px; }
```

## cheat list of selectors
```css
.name            - all items of class 'name'
#name            - ID of 'name'
div#container    - all divs with 
```
but you can combine them in other ways like:
```
li a             -
li > a           -
li + a           -
```
